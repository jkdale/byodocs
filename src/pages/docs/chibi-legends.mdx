BYO Studios has recently announced their partnership with [Chibi Legends of the Warring Kingdoms (CLOWK)](https://www.chibi.gg/), an upcoming mobile blockchain-based game and also the first of many blockchain games they partnered with. BYO Studios will be working with their team to figure out the best ways to integrate BYOPills directly into the Chibi Gaming Universe, ultimately rewarding holders with more upcoming utility and value! CLOWK has also recently partnered with The Metakey.

CLOWK is a blockchain gaming universe where you'll take on a role as a Warlord, recruiting legendary Warriors to lead your armies into battle to expand your empire and build your dream kingdom.

Starting off as a genesis collection of 5,555 procedurally-generated unique Chibi Legends, CLOWK will have a multi-phase gaming roadmap featuring the first play-to-earn auto-battler game, an interactive story game series, and a recruitment system for collectors to create new Legend NFTs.

The team behind CLOWK consists of gaming industry veterans and entrepreneurs who have developed and published games played by millions - and now they're looking to raise the bar with NFT games!
