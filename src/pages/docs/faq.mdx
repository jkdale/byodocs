## Launch
### What is BYOPills?
Blue Yellow Orange Pills AKA BYOPills is a collection of 10,000 unique, procedurally generated, 3D pills created by Boris The Cook along his journey to reach maximum brain enlightenment. 


### When did it launch?

The project launched on July 17th 2021.


### What was the mint price?

0.06 ETH + Gas.


### How were pills created?

Each pill is randomly generated by combining over 160 traits with varying rarities in 6 categories including: Pill Cap, Pill Bottom, Ingredient, Background, Aura and Trip. These use a real-time rendering engine to allow us to create beautiful animations for that many pills.

### When was the snapshot taken?
August 8th 2021 at 11:59am PST / 8:59pm CET


### How can I verify that I was included in the snapshot?

Enter your eth address at [https://byopills.com/snapshot](https://byopills.com/snapshot) to check whether you were part of the snapshot and how many access keys you can mint.


### I bought a few pills before the snapshot and have held them since. How do I get my access keys?

Minting was scheduled for September 9th @ 9:00am PST and was open for 5 days. 1 pill = 1 access key. 


### What can I do with access keys?

You'll be able to redeem them for an Apostle avatar for free (+gas). The Apostles are a utility-driven, game-ready 3D avatar.


### I wasnâ€™t part of the snapshot. I've now got 2 pills. Can I mint an access key?

Unfortunately, you canâ€™t. If you didn't have any pills at the time of the snapshot you won't be able to mint an Access Key. However, you will be able to purchase an Access Key in the secondary market.


### I had 10 pills in my wallet when the snapshot was taken. I've now got 8. How many access keys will I be able to mint?

You can mint 8 keys. If you buy more pills, you will be able to mint up to 10 because you had 10 pills at the time of the snapshot.


### I traded a few pills after the snapshot was taken. I've still got the same total number of pills, just upgraded a few. Can I still mint access keys for them?

Yes, you don't need to have the exact same pills.


### Whatâ€™s the purpose of buying a pill post-snapshot?

Owning a BYOPill will give you access to future metaverse / blockchain game integrations (in the form of experiences / consumables such as power-ups, ability boosts, etc.), the Trip Replicator App, future VR trip experiences, more exclusive drops, and not to mention utility in the BYOVERSE ðŸ‘€ â€¦ A BYOPill will be the main ingredient in everything we cook up in future developments. 

BYOPills and their rarities might also have an impact on the Apostle you claim and will also impact utility in the BYOVERSEâ€¦(more on that later).
