## Overview

### What is the BYOVape?
Everything in the BYOVERSE is BYOEncrypted which requires you to inhale your BYOPill through the BYOVape, a biological verification tool. Inhaling the BYOVape grants you access to certain areas of the BYOVERSE including the BYOP Facility and its restricted areas, while also allowing you to power-up certain items.

A Snapshot was taken of all BYOPill holders on November 19th, 2021, allowing holders to claim a free BYOVape for each BYOPill owned. Claiming BYOVapes will require an equal amount of BYOPills at the time of minting. To check snapshot eligibility, click here.

This BYOVape will include a one-time use pod, granting you access to the BYOCraft Manufacturing Plant, from which holders will be able to get their BYOCrafts.

**1 BYOVape + 1 BYOPill = 1 BYOCraft**
