This page is dedicated to the policies of BYODocs. By using this documentation, which includes viewing or accessing the contents of this site, all users agree and follow these policies to ensure consistency in content and to protect existing contributors and contributions.

- Vandalism, vulgar language and linking to irrelevant websites are strictly prohibited. Offenders will be banned and their edits removed. Avoid edit wars. If your edits are being reverted persistently and you feel the content should/shouldn't be there, please consult an Administrator. Keep in mind that this documentation is open to the public, and no editors will be punished for editing in good faith.
- This documentation is a public encyclopedia. Contributions are appreciated, but editors must understand that everything contributed will become available to the public and credits will not be distributed.
- Communicating or discussing with members of the BYOCommunity in other languages is fine. However, content in articles, forums and blogs must be edited in English.
- Many pages are protected. This may be due to excessive vandalism, high quality page, or the page consisting complex coding. If you still cannot make an edit, it is likely Administrator locked and you will need to contact an Administrator about any edits to that page. Suggesting changes to a protected page rewards you with one Editor Point. Gaining 10 of these points allows you access to edit protected pages.
