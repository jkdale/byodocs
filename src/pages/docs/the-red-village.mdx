The original announcement was the start of the relationship with The Red Village, with more utility expected to be announced for BYOPills and Apostles as the game develops.

The game will feature different factions, BYOPills being the first. Factions can fight each other in large scale fights, and get their own custom-built home battle arena. Other factions to be announced soon include: ZED RUN, The Sandbox, Decentraland, DeadHeads and Metakey.

To be part of the BYOPills faction, you'll need a BYOPill or an Apostle in your wallet, along with a Champion NFT from The Red Village.
