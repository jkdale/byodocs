## Overview
### Clothing Line Development

From the [BYOPill Discord](https://discord.gg/dbMUkR8dY2) it became clear that BYO Studios is indeed working with fashion experts in order to position themselves properly for an extreme collaboration when the offer presents itself.

It became clear that the team will be offering high end tech wear with  technology features such as those listed in the announcement, but additionally they will also cover simple stuff like hoodies, shirts, caps, and etc. due to the mass appeal.

An important thing to take note of is that BYO Studios is setting themselves apart from any existing NFT clothing line as they are targeting a different segment of clothing, which allows additional apparel brands to make a jump into the NFT world and possibly do a collaboration.
