## Overview
### PRE-RELEASE
A day prior to the BYOCraft launch (date is yet to be announced), a snapshot of all [BYOVape](/docs/byovape) holders, [BYOPill](/docs/byopill) holders, and [Apostle](/docs/apostles) holders will be made. Once the snapshots are taken, the one-time use [BYOVapes](/docs/byovape) will either be "burned" or "deactivated", meaning they will no longer have a pod attached to it. However, they will still have a purpose in the BYOVERSE.

All those who held a BYOVape at the time of these snapshots will be airdropped a BYOCraft equal to the number of pills & vapes they own during the snapshot. 

**1 BYOVape + 1 BYOPill = 1 BYOCraft**

**1 BYOVape + 1 BYOPill + 1 Apostle = 1 custom BYOCraft based on Apostle traits**

The Apostles you own in the second snapshot will effect the TYPE of BYOCraft that will be airdropped to you. A Voyager will receive a voyager-only type craft, a Psychonaut will receive a psychonaut-only type craft, etc. If you have more pills & vapes then Apostles, then you will receive a "general"-type craft which can be used by all types of Apostles.
