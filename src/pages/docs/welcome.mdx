Welcome to the BYODocs, a encyclopedia about the BYOPills and its ecosystem, powered by the BYOCommunity. Our purpose is to create the most complete documentation about everything BYO related.

## Quick Project Overview
### BYOPills

Blue Yellow Orange Pills (BYOPills) are a collection of 10,000 unique NFT pills stored on the Ethereum network and hosted on IPFS. Each pill has a number of aesthetic traits, up to 17 'trip effect' traits and look dope af. All of the pills were minted on 16/07/2021 at the price of 0.06Îž.

### The Concept
The long-term vision is to integrate BYOPills with various metaverses & blockchain games, providing collectors access to a number of benefits. As a metaverse consumable, you can think of BYOPills as gaming power-ups which never run out and can be used in many different places. BYOPill owners will have access to unique visual experiences in AR/VR, utility in many blockchain games, access to special experiences in virtual worlds and a place in a community full of good vibes.

### BYOVerse
The BYOVerse is a 3D virtual world where your BYOPills and Apostle avatars can be utilized. The economy will be powered by $TRYP, a token generated by holding an Apostle. You'll be able to explore, hang out, engage in PVP and complete quests. See you in the 'verse.
