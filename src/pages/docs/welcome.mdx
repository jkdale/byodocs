import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

Welcome to the BYODocs, a encyclopedia about the BYOPills and its ecosystem, powered by the BYOCommunity. Our purpose is to create the most complete documentation about everything BYO related.

BYODocs is maintained by BYO holders and fans from around the world and we welcome anyone to join our community, share your knowledge, and make this documentation a better place. New editors are encouraged to take note of our Policies or contact an Administrator or Moderator for any questions regarding the BYODocs. A great place to start helping is to look into our current site-wide Projects for needed edits and contributions. Volunteer developers and researchers are always welcomed!

As the docs will undergo multiple iterations we highly encourage you to post feedback, bug reports, or suggestions to the official administrators.
