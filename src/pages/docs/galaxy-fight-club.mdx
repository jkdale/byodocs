‍We are officially announcing our partnership with [Galaxy Fight Club](https://galaxyfightclub.com/)(GFC), the "Super Smash Bros" of blockchain gaming. They have Fighters in the form of NFT avatars, weapons, and now they are integrating BYOPills as their in-game consumable that allows players to equip and consume for temporary boosts.

*Below video demonstrates Cyberkongz avatars playing GFC.*

## Overview
### What does it mean?
‍Every [BYOPill](/docs/byopills/) will act as an in-game consumable in Galaxy Fight Club, giving you an advantage in winning battles and earning $GCOIN, their in-game utility token. As of now, consumables will come in 5 different forms, each having different temporary durations: 

- Invulnerability
- Increased Movement Speed
- Increased Attack Damage (Berserk)
- Camouflage (invisibility)
- Instant Attack Cooldowns

**‍The type of consumable your BYOPill will represent will depend on your Pill's aesthetic traits, while the duration will be based on a combination of your pill's "# of trip effects" and "trip levels". All pills will act as consumables in GFC.**

### Galaxy Fight Club Exclusive Pills
‍We have also created single-purpose BYOPill-branded consumable exclusive to the GFC universe. This will be a completely separate GFC game-only version of pills (consumables) included in their loot packages. Our partnership with GFC marks the first big step in our long journey of introducing consumables to blockchain gaming while pushing for NFT interoperability. This will be one of many future partnerships, continuously expanding pill utility as the consumable of future blockchain games / metaverses (excluding utility provided in the  BYOVERSE).

## GFC Partners Guide

### Tournaments
In addition to BYOPills acting as power-ups, BYOPill holders will be able to participate in GFC's 3v3 P2E game mode with their Apostles soon. As a partnered avatar, you'll be given a base weapon for use and will get combat bonuses when having team members from the same collection.

All official partners of the Galaxy Fight Club are able to login with their favorite NFTs and battle with holders from other projects in their 3v3 mode.

3v3 is GFCs main game mode and allow any player to participate whatever avatar they are playing with, a 3v3 match is over when either team has 20 points (1 point = 1 kill) which usually takes around 5 minutes per match. Having team members from the same collection gives the entire team combat bonuses, for example having 3 Animetas characters of having 3 Cyberkongz in the same team.

Partnered avatars will be given a base weapon whenever they enter the game. Weapon types could for example be a sword, pistol or any other basic tier weapon. GFC weapons are divided in 8 tiers: basic, common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, mythic and exotic.

### Rewards
Partnered project players will also be able to play-to-earn inside our game, at the end of every match the winning team will have a chance of winning keys which are unique NFTs that can be used to open loot boxes for rewards. You have the choice of either selling these keys on secondary markets for $ETH or use them to open loot boxes for more rewards, however opening loot boxes will require $GCOIN which is generated by Genesis Galaxy Fighters but can also be purchased on exchanges.

There are three different type of keys that could be won inside the game depending on the avatar and weapon you are using.

**Gold Keys**
- Gold keys are the highest tier keys, these allow you to open loot boxes with high tier weapons and armor.
- You can only win Gold keys from matches if you are equipped with a Genesis Weapon from our Genesis Gear Collection (note: released by now).

*Genesis Keys allow all partnered project players to receive weapons and also act as access keys to win the highest tiers of loot inside the game, making use of 100% of our play-to-earn mechanics.*

**Partner Keys**
- Partner keys can also be won if there is existing integration set up with the particular partner.
- Partner keys can open loot boxes to win that project’s specific loot, for example to win the partner’s project native tokens (e.g. $BANANAs) or NFTs (e.g. Sandbox skins/merch).

**Silver Keys**
- In the case that there is no integration set up with the partner, and you are playing with a non-Genesis weapon, you will still be able to win Silver keys which allow you to win Basic tier weapons and amour from loot boxes.
