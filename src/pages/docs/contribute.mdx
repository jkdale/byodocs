**NOTE: Application form has been closed whilst we are forming the team.**

BYODocs is maintained by BYO holders who wants to enhance the experience of newcomers and long-term holders by consolidating anything BYO related from BYO Studios official website, Twitter, and Discord into one source.

BYO Studios is rewarding contributors who contributed in a significant matter every month:

> (...) we will assign a monthly budget to reward community members who are willing to put time to contribute to the development of the BYODocs in a meaningful way!

There is no requirement for previous experience. We welcome anyone who wants to collaborate and improve the workings of BYODocs as we strive to become the #1 source for anything BYO related.
